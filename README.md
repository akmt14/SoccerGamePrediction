# Bayesian Analysis to predict Premier League match results

Analysis of sports data has piqued high research interests to serve many goals such as improving performance of players, preparing winning strategies, analyzing post-game statistics and many others. I, Akshay, follow soccer religiously & when we came across this dataset, we decided that it would be an interesting project to work on. We are keen to see if our models can predict game outcomes looking at history of soccer matches using Bayesian Methods.
