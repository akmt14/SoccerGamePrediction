# Soccer Score Predictions Using Bayesian Methods

Analysis of sports data has piqued high research interests to serve many goals such as improving performance of players, preparing winning strategies, analyzing post-game statistics and many others.

We are keen to see if our models can predict game outcomes looking at history of soccer matches using Bayesian Methods.
